* About Me 

I'm a Software Engineer with a mixed background in Systems, Data-Intensive Applications, Web Backend and Machine Learning. Over the last decade of my career I've been focusing on creating platforms for building Big Data and Machine Learning products.

I started my Software journey by contibuting to open-source reverse engineering projects ([[https://macroquest.org/][MacroQuest]] & [[https://www.eqemulator.org/][EQEmu]]) and it remains a fascination of mine. I am hoping to contribute more to these efforts and document my discoveries in this blog.

Besides Software I'm interested in personal development (finances, fitness, diet). I began cycling with a power meter in in 2019 and have been contributing to open-source software in the endurance athletics space ([[https://www.goldencheetah.org/][GoldenCheetah]]).

I also [[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33494702-tadek][like books]], play bad guitar. You can normally find me [[https://www.strava.com/athletes/mkusper][on my bike]].


* Interests

My main interests in technology revolve around building more capable and cost-effective Data/ML platform solutions. I'm consistently trying to improve my own engineering rigor in developing systems and software, and helping others to do the same.
